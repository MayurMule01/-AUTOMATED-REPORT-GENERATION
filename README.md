* This project automates the process of generating a professional PDF report from structured data stored in a file (e.g., CSV). The script reads the data, performs basic statistical analysis (such as averages, counts, min/max), and then generates a neatly formatted PDF report. This is especially useful for generating summary reports for students, employees, sales, inventory, etc., saving time and reducing manual work.
* Here we can use the libraries like FPDF or REPORTLAB.
* we also create a sheet where student data are stored (students.csv)
* Tools used for complete a task : Google, Notes Provided by "CODTECH IT SOLUTION" , Chatgpt for pandas library.
* After execution of the code it shows the student report pdf.
* The core idea of this project is to develop a Python script that reads data from a commonly used file format (CSV), performs meaningful analysis using data-processing libraries, and then converts the results into a professional, formatted PDF document. This end-to-end automation is achieved using Pythonâ€™s powerful data analysis library Pandas, combined with FPDF or ReportLab for PDF generation.
* The project workflow begins with reading the input data file and (.csv) containing structured information such as student marks.
* Using Pandas, the script processes the data by applying grouping, aggregation, and statistical functions like calculating the average, minimum, and maximum values.
* Once the analysis is complete, the data is formatted into tables and written to a PDF document using FPDF or ReportLab.
* After the analysis FPDF (Free PDf) will be created.
* Finally Student data is shown in PDF file in structural way.
