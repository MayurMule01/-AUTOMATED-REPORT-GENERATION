* This project automates the process of generating a professional PDF report from structured data stored in a file (e.g., CSV). The script reads the data, performs basic statistical analysis (such as averages, counts, min/max), and then generates a neatly formatted PDF report. This is especially useful for generating summary reports for students, employees, sales, inventory, etc., saving time and reducing manual work.
* Here we can use the libraries like FPDF or REPORTLAB.
* we also create a sheet where student data are stored (students.csv)
* Tools used for complete a task : Google, Provided Notes by "CODTECH IT SOLUTION" , Chatgpt for pandas library.
* After execution of the code it shows the student report pdf.
